Songs will never slow down, for a "slower" map we just remove some of the generated notes. This way we only need to make one map per song

## HitOBjects

key, offset, endoffset

key is what directional arrow will be generated

offset is the time in milliseconds from the start of the song

endoffset is the time in milliseconds from the start of the song
	
	* only relevant for "Hold notes"
	
	* default value will be equal to offset
